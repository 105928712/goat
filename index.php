                <p>
                We train our new employees predominantly through on-the-job training as we 
                believe experience is best earned in real-life scenarios. 
                On-the-job training enables new employees to interact with and become familiar with their role, 
                workplace environment, colleagues and management. 
                We also provide some off-the-job training options. 
                Materials such as written guides and handbooks are also provided, 
                as well as optional online courses to help educate employees further. 
                Training is a mandatory part of a new employeeâ€™s induction.
